Nine MacOS Folder PNGs to customize your machine.

You just have to CMD+C in the PNG you want, right click on the folder you want to change, go "Get Info", and CMD+V right on the small icon next to the name.

You could also get one of these PNGs and change the color to whatever you like using PhotoShop or other software like this.
